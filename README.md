Algos and DStructs
==================

This repo is going to be used to hold a collection of algorithms and data structures I have developed.

They will be written in JavaScript.

## Tests

Tests are all in the `/test` folder. The tests use `mocha` framework. To install and run tests, follow these instructions:

```
$ npm install -g mocha
$ mocha
```
